                        <p>The wind turbine was constructed using a PVC pipe and four printed blades. First, a 15 cm-long plastic tube (3.5 cm diameter) was partly flattened on one end and a metal rod inserted and fastened with hot glue. The tube was then attached to a wooden base with a hole in the center, achieving a snug fit without the use of additional couplings.</p>
                        <p>Next, four 3D-printed blades were attached to the tube using hot glue. The blades were designed to catch the wind and convert it to rotational energy. Finally, the Savonius-blade assembly was mounted on a short steel stand.</p>

                        <p>The PHS system was designed to pump water to a higher elevation, storing energy in the form of potential energy.

                        <p>When discharge is needed, the ball valve is opened and water flows through the micro-turbine, converting the stored potential energy back into electrical energy.</p>

                        <p>For the hydro test, four tests were conducted by varying the water pump's position relative to the water surface. Additionally, the electrical output of the micro-turbine turbine was measured during water discharge.</p>

                    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                    <p>After converting the prototype, recommendations were made based on experimental findings to enhance the system's performance. Specifically, using larger impeller sizes and more segments in the turbine blades is recommended for better energy output. Additionally, the system should be tested in real wind conditions in Egypt, due to its steady wind availability and natural access to national energy grids, making it an ideal location for renewable energy development.</p>
